## Features
- Terminal-based Christmas tree animation using ANSI colors
- Falling snow effect with random movement
- Blinking star and Christmas lights
- Press `Ctrl + C` to exit the program

## ⚠️ Notes

* When running the program, the output may appear slow or look like the terminal is lagging.
* This is expected behavior due to the animation effect.
* Increasing the height of the terminal window will make the animation appear smoother.
* If the screen looks cluttered, resize the terminal and run the program again.
